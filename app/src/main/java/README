HomeActivity:
    - this is where you start
    - The following are the visible components:
        - ListView to list all the rules
        - a button for creating new rules
    - the following are the background components:
        - alarmManager schedules the bdPendIntent according to the Rule that was created recently
        - bdServiceIntent starts a service which runs the bdReceiver in the background
            - This way, the bdReceiver keeps listening to events even when the application is closed

CreateRuleActivity:
    - starts with a single Spinner (appSpinner) which allows you to choose an app
    - appMap has the list of App objects supported
    - rule is the new Rule object that we will be creating and sending to HomeActivity
    - registerButton returns back to HomeActivity with the new rule

MySpinner:
    - To display a list of items you need to define an adapter, hence a new class
    - it also has a type which is used in the MySpinnerListener

MySpinnerListener:
    - Every time you choose an item from the spinner, the next spinner will be created depending
    on the chosen item
    - the rule object is also progressively stores info related to the chosen item
    - it has a reference to the layout of the activity to create new spinners
    - it also has a reference to the list of app objects for the "then" spinner

RuleGrammar:
    <rule> := <if><when><where><then>
        <if> := <app> <feature> <compare value>
            <feature> := intent string
            <compare value> = string
        <when> = <hour> <min> <interval>
        <then> = same as <if> except <change value> instead of <compare value>

App:
    - All apps that are to be supported should extend from App class
    - Each App object has a separate list of "if" features and "then" features


Control Flow:
    - HomeActivity presents the user with list of registered rules
    - when CreateRuleButton clicked the control is transferred to CreateRuleActivity
    - CreateRuleActivity starts with a single Spinner (appSpinner)
    - spinners are dynamically created depending the on the user's choice
    - in future, we want the number of spinners displayed to also be dynamic depending on the
    application
    - when registerButton is clicked, we return back to HomeActivity
    - CreateRuleActivity returns with a new Rule object
    - HomeActivity writes the list of rules along with the new one, to disk
    - it updates the alarmManager
    - get the updated list of actions from the list of rules including the new Rule
    - restart the broadcast receiver service (bdServiceIntent)
    - from the intent that started it, MyService gets the list of broadcast actions
    - it registers the broadcast receiver
    - MyBroadcastReceiver keeps listening to the actions that were registered
    - upon trigger, it reads the list of rules from disk
    - for every rule, check "when" and "if" condition
    - get "then" intents and start all of them
    - remember that the alarmManager can also start a broadcast receiver
